Deep learning on microseismic data

Please note: This repository is large, so uses GitLFS.  All your downloads of this repository use my GitLFS bandwidth, which is limited.  If I have no bandwidth left, you'll have to wait till next month to download, boohoo.

This repo is designed to be used in conjunction with the paper
Andy H Wilkins, Andrew Strange, Yi Duan and Xun Luo (2020) "Identifying microseismic events in a mining scenario using a convolutional neural network" â€‚Computers and Geosciences 137:104418
